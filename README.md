# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

This project uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. A model was developed to output steering angle to an autonomous vehicle. It was developed, trained and tested using Keras.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Files and Dependancies

My project includes the following files:
* [model.py](model.py) contains the script to create and train the model
* [utils.py](utils.py) contains the preprocessing steps for the dataset
* [drive.py](drive.py) used for driving the car in autonomous mode
* [model.h5](model.h5) contains a trained convolution neural network 
* [writeup.md](writeup.md) explains the results
* [video.py](video.py) takes in the recording images from drive.py and combines them into a video
* [run1.mp4](run1.mp4) is the video output of video.py, showing the simulator running in autonomous mode from the trained model
* [histogram.py](histogram.py) outputs a histogram of the training / validation set to better understand data representation

This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

* [CarND Simulator](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58ae4594_mac-sim.app/mac-sim.app.zip)

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument `run1` is the directory to save the images seen by the agent to. If the directory already exists it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp when the image image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Create a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be name of the directory following by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

The video will run at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
